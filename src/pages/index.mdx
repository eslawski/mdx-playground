import { Link } from 'gatsby'

import Layout from '../components/layout'
import Image from '../components/image'

The SEO should probably not be in here but rather the main layout.js component
<SEO title="Home" keywords={['gatsby', 'application', 'react']} />

# Welcome
try going to <Link to="/why-not/">First page</Link>

TODO
- Port over the image gallery component. How can you query for images? Maybe this (could also make Image component more performant): https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/mdx/writing-pages/#graphql-queries
- Implement list of posts (in card layout). Checkout out slawski-blog for this.
- Will you be continuing work in this repo? If so maybe rename it
- Lots of styling
- Components for interactive blog images
- Simplify the logic gatsby-node.js

Great recent example: https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog

WHEN IN DOUBT:
1) Delete .cache dir
2) Delete public dir
3) Run a fresh 'gatsby build'
4) Run 'gatsby serve' to make sure things are looking correct
4) Should be able to continue using 'gatsby develop'

<div style={{ maxWidth: '300px', marginBottom: '1.45rem' }}>
</div>
