# Personal Website

Welcome to my website. This website built from scratch using [gatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)

This image heavy blog heavily utilizes the image processing features of Gatsby and takes advantage of `mdx` to create complex reusable components that can be used in markdown.

### Developing locally
Currently requires node v10.
```sh
nvm use 10
npm install
gatsby develop
```
