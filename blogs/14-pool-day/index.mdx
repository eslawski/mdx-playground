Today was a little bittersweet because it was the last day of an awesome vacation out west. Katie and I got to experience some of the most beautiful scenery this area has to offer. The last couple days in Vegas have been fun, but we are ready to come home.

Starting off the morning we went to the Wicked Spoon buffet which was located in our hotel. It is supposedly the top rated buffet in Vegas, and I can see why. When I booked the hotel they actually included two buffets for free.

The food was quite amazing. It was only 9:30am and they had everything from breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert.

The rest of the day was spent lounging around at all of the three pools available in our hotel. It was a much needed relaxation day after our non-stop vacation mode.

Around dinner time we wanted to find somewhere to watch the Thursday Night Football game. We landed on Beer Park which is a rooftop bar outside the Paris hotel.
