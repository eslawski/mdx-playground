Our day started by waking up at 5:30am. We didn't have to be up for at least another two hours, but you know it’s VACATION DAY! We packed up all our last minute stuff, and were graciously dropped off at the airport by my parents.

The flight was just under 4 hours. About midway through the pilot told us to look out our windows. Thankfully we were on the correct side of the aircraft, because we got to see a birds eye view of the Grand Canyon.

After we touched down, we hopped in a rental car and hit the road. Our first destination on this trip is Tusayan, AZ, home of the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. It was our first time renting a car so that was a fun experience. We had a 4 hour drive ahead of us.

Midway through our trip we hit up a grocery store to stock up on some trail food. We also made another pitstop for dinner at the Grand Canyon Brewing Company. After a long day of traveling nothing tasted better than a nice crisp IPA.

We finally reached our hotel at around 7:30pm local time, which translates to 10:30pm our body time. The plan is to get a good night’s rest in preparation for a very exciting hike tomorrow.

A couple months ago, when we were looking at what hikes we wanted to do in the Grand Canyon there was one that jumped out at us. It was the South Kaibab Trail. This trail winds all the way down to the bottom of the Grand Canyon to the Colorado River. Only problem was due to its length, it is not a recommended day hike. HOWEVER a couple days ago Katie and I snagged a last minute cancellation for a stay at Phantom Ranch! In order to stay here people typically must enter a lottery system 13 months in advance.

That being said there will unfortunately be no blog tomorrow. There is no internet or even cell signal down in the canyon (just a payphone). Anyways check back in a couple of days for a double down blog!
