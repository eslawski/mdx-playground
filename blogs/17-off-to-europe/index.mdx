For a few months now, Katie and I have been planning a trip to Europe. On our itinerary is London, Paris, Rotterdam, and finally Amsterdam. Tuesday after getting home from work we both threw all of our stuff in our bags and departed for the airport for our 10:30pm flight.

The flight itself wasn't too bad. It was about 7 hours. We tried our best to get a couple hours of sleep, but it wasn't easy. When we finally landed we found the nearest SIM card vending machine so that we could hook up our phones to that European network.

From there we hopped on "The Tube" and headed into the heart of downtown London. We got off at "Piccadilly Circus" which is essentially London's version of New York Times Square.

For our overnight accommodations we booked a hostel for a few nights in the SoHo district. This part of the city is pretty dense with tourists, but it's in a great location. We are within walking distance of many bars/restaurants, and not too far from the Tube that connects all of London.

Katie and I finally got to the hostel. We dropped off our stuff and walked around finding a place to eat. We settled at place called "Old Compton". It was a great little place with open air seating, and it was a beautiful day to enjoy it. We both got the lunch special which came with a half pint of beer.

Even though we were low on energy, we knew we needed to try and stay up in order to become acclimated to the time change. So we headed to Hyde Park for a walk. After enjoying the sites of park from a nice bench, we decided to head back.

We finally made it back to the hostel in time for their happy hour at the bar (where I am currently writing this blog). Tomorrow we are hoping for an early start to the day to explore more of London!
