Two years ago I married my best friend, and it has been full of adventures. Today adds yet another to our story together. We got to hike to one of the most beautiful lookouts at Zion National Park (Observation Point).

Parking at Zion, is extremely competitive. It usually runs out of it’s 450 parking spots by 8:00am, so we knew we had to get there early. Our hotel is about 30 minutes from the park, so we got an early head start.

Once in the park you are required to take shuttles everywhere. At this point in the morning there is quite a line for outbound shuttles. From the time we parked to when we actually got to the trailhead, an hour had gone by. If we were to do it all again, we probably wouldn’t have gotten a hotel so far away, and instead paid the bucko-bucks to stay in Springdale, UT (right outside the park).

The big trail for the day was called Observation Point. It was an 8 mile round trip hike climbing 2100 ft. We decided on this hike because it supposedly offers the best views of the park, and it is not nearly as busy as the popular Angel’s Landing hike.

Even if you don’t make it up the full 4 miles, there are still some incredible views to be had all along this hike showcasing many different areas of the park.

Once we got to the top the views were truly incredible. You could see the road winding around the park through the mountains as far as the eye can see. We could also even see people hiking the dangerous Angel’s Landing hike out in the distance. We took loads of pictures so be sure to check them out at the very end too.

After enjoying some lunch at the top we began our descent down. At the bottom we made a slight detour to check out the Weeping Rock. We would have also checked out the Hidden Canyon, but that trail was closed due to damage caused by a rainstorm from over a month ago.

We ended the day by hitting up the Zion Brewing Company. The best part was this little brewery sat right outside the park entrance, so we just walked right over.
