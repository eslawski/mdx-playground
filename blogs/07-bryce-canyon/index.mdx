Today we said goodbye to Lake Powell and headed to Bryce Canyon. We left late morning and it was about a three hour drive which consisted of a total of 3 turns. The drive itself was again beautiful through some remote parts of Arizona and into Utah.

Once we got close to Bryce Canyon, we pulled off on the side of the road. I had rigged up a car mount for the gopro using one of those industrial strength suction cups. I suctioned it to the hood of our car and we drove down into the valley where we were staying.

We finally arrived in Tropic, UT where we were staying. We are renting a cabin for a couple nights. It practically has the same amenities as a hotel room, just with our own individual unit. Though there is wifi, but it doesn't quite have the firepower we need to backup all our videos. So check back soon for video footage later.

By that time it was late afternoon, so we decided to go quickly checkout the vistas at Bryce Canyon. Parking was pretty limited so we had to take shuttles around.

The first stop was Bryce Point. This lookout was the first glimpse we got of this unique canyon made of “hoodoos”. They look like those drippy sand castles you used to make at the beach when you were a little kid.

We then walked around the Rim Trail all the way to Inspiration Point. In my opinion, these are where the best views were. Off in the distance we could actually see the small town of Tropic where we were staying.

We ended the day by grabbing dinner at a place within walking distance of our cabin. The place was an old barn converted into a restaurant that played live country music.

Tomorrow is a full hiking day as we plan on going down into the canyon and checking out the hoodoos up close!
