Our Babymoon technically started yesterday with a quick stop at the Miloch Cottage on Burt Lake where we enjoyed a full day sunshine and boating.
I gave "wake surfing" a try for the first time, but was not able to actually get up out of the water. Next year!
After many failed attempts we cracked some cold ones (Katie some La Croix) and we hung out at the sandbar.

After that we enjoyed a nice sunset and a late night bonfire.

Being at the tail end of the pandemic and Katie being unvaccinated, we decided not to stay at the Miloch Cottage overnight.
Instead we rented an AirBnb about 20 minutes away, still right on Burt Lake.
The owners, Dorthy and John were extremely welcoming and eccentric to say the least.
Despite being 76 years old, they had just run a half marathon that morning.
They also showed us all their medals over the last 40 years.
There had to have been at least 500 of them.

The accommodations were pretty interesting.
It felt like we were staying at someones house full of trophies and kids toys.
The bed was also hard as a rock, but thankfully we were only there one night.

The next morning we woke up and headed straight for the UP.
Burt Lake is only like 30 minutes from the bridge, so we got to enjoy driving that with some morning coffee.

It was about a 4 hour drive to Marquette.
We stopped at various parks along the way taking in the simple undisturbed beauty the UP offers.
When we arrived, our hotel was not ready.
So we went to go grab some lunch and walked over the famous Jean Kay's Pasties to grab some lunch.

To burn off some calories we then went for a hike up Sugarloaf Mountain.
The hike wasn't very hard, but it offered amazing views of Lake Superior and Marquette in the distance.
Being 31 weeks pregnant, Katie got interesting stares from other hikers.
But she totally owned it!

After that we were hungry for an early dinner.
We posted up at the Iron Bay restaurant and enjoyed dinner outside.
We noticed that Marquette was dealing with a pretty large labor shortage, so seating at the place was very limited.
We heard they stopped taking names for dinner because the wait got to be so long.

To top things off, we headed around the corner and enjoyed one last brew at Ore Dock Brewery\!

After the long day, we headed back to our hotel and slowly drifted off to sleep while watching some Shark Tank.
