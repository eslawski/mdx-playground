They say that a picture is worth 1000 words. I would generally agree,
but have you ever had those moments where you experienced something so spectacular you thought...

> Wow, pictures just don't do it justice.

I often find myself saying this. Pictures are great at preserving a small instant
in time, but they are not able to capture the little details it takes to __tell a story__.

When I was a little kid, we would go on vacation and my parents would make us write
in a journal to document our day. Of course, being a little kid I dreaded it, but a couple
years ago I stumbled upon them. It felt like I relived every moment. I documented things
I probably would have never remembered otherwise. Little did I know I would be inspiring my future 26 year old self.

With a big vacation coming up, I thought about what I could do document our trip other than just taking pictures.
Seeing as I do it for a living, I decided to make a website!

The goal on vacation is release one blog a day.
They will be packed with pictures, stories, and hopefully videos of our adventures.
 Thanks for coming to check out the blog, and be sure to tune in again soon! 🏜️
