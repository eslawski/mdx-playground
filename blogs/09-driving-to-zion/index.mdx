Today we woke up in Bryce and walked across the street to our favorite little coffee house. We checked out of our cabin and hit the road headed to Zion National Park.

Before we left, we decided to hit up one more quick hike as it was on the way. It was called Mossy Cave, and it was only 0.8 miles. This little trek proved to be well worth it. We got to see a waterfall nestled within the Bryce Canyon scenery, as well as a cave covered in moss. Apparently these are both great sights to see in the winter months too.

The drive to Zion was about 3 hours. In order to get to our hotel we had to actually travel through the park. Words cannot explain how epically beautiful this drive was. I managed to get more video footage with our makeshift gopro car mount.

We finally arrived at our hotel and the rest of the day was spent doing laundry, resting our feet, and getting packed for our early morning departure to the park tomorrow.
